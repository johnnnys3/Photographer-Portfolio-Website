UI Redesign Progress - Photography Portfolio
==========================================

Based on user feedback, I've redesigned the UI to be photography-focused while using the reference image as layout inspiration:

## Completed Changes:

### Phase 1: Color System & Design Tokens ✅
- Updated CSS custom properties to black and white theme
- Replaced all color variables with monochromatic palette
- Updated both light and dark themes

### Phase 2: Navigation Redesign ✅
- Changed branding from "ULEAF" to "LENS" (photography-focused)
- Updated navigation links: Portfolio, About, Contact
- Added "Book Session" button instead of "Join As Volunteer"
- **NEW**: Added back button (appears when not on home page)
- **NEW**: Added home button (appears when not on home page)
- Implemented responsive mobile menu with navigation buttons

### Phase 3: HomePage Content Redesign ✅
- **REMOVED**: Hero section with "Capturing moments. Creating memories." content
- **KEPT**: Image carousel at top (now shows "Recent Shoots")
- **KEPT**: Featured Gallery section with grid layout
- **KEPT**: About Preview section ("Behind the Lens")

### Phase 4: ImageCarousel Updates ✅

- Mobile: Responsive menu with all navigation options

## Key Features Implemented:
1. **Smart Navigation**: Back and home buttons appear contextually
2. **Photography Focus**: All content now relates to photography portfolio
3. **Clean Layout**: Removed unnecessary hero section, streamlined flow
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
5. **Black & White Theme**: Consistent monochromatic design
6. **User-Friendly**: Clear navigation with proper back/home functionality

## Current Status:
- ✅ Color system updated
- ✅ Navigation redesigned with back/home buttons
- ✅ Hero section removed as requested
- ✅ Content made photography-focused
- ✅ Layout issues resolved
- 🔄 Testing responsive design
- 🔄 Final functionality testing

The design now follows the reference layout structure but is properly adapted for a photography portfolio website.
